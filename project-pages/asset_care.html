        <div class="body-text">This project marked the beginning of my professional career. During the initial scoping phase, we underestimated its scale but were acutely aware of its potential impact on our end users at the site. The report we aimed to develop would significantly aid operations in better training and minimizing alarms linked to major failure modes of haul trucks.</div>
        <div class="body-text">The data for this project was scattered across Teck's GCP Data Lake in various forms. From scratch, I created and curated the datasets, meticulously analyzing and cleaning them until they were polished and performant enough to be integrated into a Power BI report. Working closely with our stakeholders in an Agile fashion, I developed useful visuals and views tailored to their needs.</div>
        <div class="body-text">The outcome of this project was a comprehensive report that saved $1.2 million for FRO in preventative maintenance costs. Additionally, it significantly enhanced the overall value generated by our preventative maintenance team, demonstrating the profound impact of data-driven insights on operational efficiency and cost savings.</div>
