      <div class="project-details-content">
        <div class="body-text">Shortly after graduating from university, I sought to test my programming skills by
          building a simple command-line tool. I chose Rust for this project, as it was a language I had been eager to
          learn for some time. This endeavor provided a perfect opportunity to familiarize myself with Rust's syntax and
          features while creating something practical and useful.</div>
        <div class="body-text">The CLI tool I developed, though basic, is quite functional. It acts as a "mini grep,"
          accepting a few arguments. The first argument specifies the query or word you are searching for, and the
          second specifies the file in which to search. Additionally, you can set an environment variable to determine
          whether the search is case-sensitive or not, affecting the results accordingly. To ensure reliability, I
          incorporated testing into the project, verifying that each feature worked as intended before moving on to the
          next.</div>
        <div class="body-text">My experience with Rust and the process of creating this tool has left me thoroughly
          impressed and hooked on the language. The project not only enhanced my understanding of Rust but also ignited
          a deeper interest in exploring its capabilities further. This hands-on experience has solidified my
          appreciation for Rust's performance and safety features, and I am excited to continue working with it in
          future projects.</div>
