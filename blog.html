          <p class="blog-card-description">Refining your craft as a programmer is a never-ending journey. Recently, I've
            been learning Rust and have found some aspects challenging. I stumbled upon a video of a senior developer
            discussing how he learned new languages and advanced his skills in ones he already knew. He mentioned
            literate programming as a primary driver for his success. The reason being is that combining really strict
            and clear documentation with you code
            ensures you think about and understand what you are building.</p>
          </p>
          <p class="blog-card-description">Looking back on times I have struggled with a coding problem, I found that
            when I commented out or was very literate in
            my code, I was able to solve the problem much faster. I think this is because it forces you to think about
            the problem in a different way and
            understand the code you are writing. I will be trying to incorporate this into my coding practices moving
            forward.</p>

          <p class="blog-card-description">Recently I've been preparing for the CCNA exam. After I found a really good
            online study resource that was free it made things a lot less stressful. Since this guide requires you to
            start at square one I've found a few holes in my networking knowledge that I have been able to fill as well
            as interesting facts file aways!
          </p>
          <p class="blog-card-description">I've also been spending some hands-on time with a Cisco switch. Initially, I
            had forgotten some of the common CLI commands, but Cisco has done an excellent job of making it easy for
            users to find commands. You can use the ? anywhere, and it will display possible commands along with brief
            descriptions. I found this feature incredibly helpful while creating DHCP pools for my VLANs and blocking IP
            addresses. Instead of searching online, I could simply find the command or the next command directly in the
            CLI.

          <p class="blog-card-description">I've been working to brush up on my cybersecurity skills before completing my
            OSCP certification and taking the 48-hour exam. What I've found with Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and
            basic techniques is that it's all about spending time with the tools to recognize bugs or exploits and then
            act on them. Beyond that, it's crucial to continuously expand your understanding of operating systems,
            networks, websites, and other related areas.</p>
          <p class="blog-card-description">I'd also like to note that TryHackMe offers many useful boxes and learning paths for free. After paying for and spending a lot of time on Offensive Security's website, I've found that most of what is covered in the OSCP certification can be learned for free. However, the OSCP course does introduce some more complex techniques and tools that are valuable.</p>
